      <h2>About Us</h2>
    
      <p>Our magazine started out as the passion project of our creator Andy Moon on August of 1983 in Roswell, New Mexico. Andy and his friends had always been in love with space and ideas about the unknown and after a particular exciting conversation about space they decided to start a magazine. A few months late the first issue of Spacewalkers was published and distributed to the public. Since that day the magazine has continued to grow as more and more people became infected by the staff's enthusiam.</p>
