Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

  These are just differences in design. Mobile design starts with mobile users in mind and usually starts at a much smaller (min) viewport width. Desktop is just the opposite.


What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

  Basically it's being able to use a better, more organized syntax that also includes features that you don't have access to in just pure css.


What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

  I love being able to nest the css elements. I love the organizational possibilities of preprocessing.
  The thing I struggle with the most is just remembering the syntax. I know the more I use it though, the more comfortable with it I will become.
