      <h2>Lift Off</h2>

      <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
        marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate,
        that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

      <h3>Can We Visit Planets?</h3>

      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe,
        having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>

      <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as
        equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

        <h3>Let's Go For A Walk</h3>

        <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic.
          The Earth was absolutely round.</p>

        <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye,
          and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
