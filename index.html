 <h2>Lift Off!</h2>
<p> As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble,
   the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

   <h2>Can We Visit Planets?</h2>
<p class="bottom-content">Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.

    which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.
  </p>

  <h2>   Let's Go For A Walk </h2>
  <div class="sidebyside"> 
    
    <p class="foot-content">  The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.
  
      It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.
