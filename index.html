            <h2>Lift Off</h2>
            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. The beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

      <h3>Can we Visit Planets?</h3>

      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truely to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.
      
      <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center--an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

          <h3>Lets Go For A Walk</h3>

          <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended lokea holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.</p>

          <p>It suddenly struck me that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thump and shut one eye, and thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
