        <h2>Lift Off</h2>
        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble,
          the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if
          you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

        <h2>Can We Visit Planets?</h2>
        <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having
          the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.
          The airman's earth, if free men make it.

          <h2>Let's Go For A Walk</h2>
          <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The
            Earth was absolutely round. It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up
            my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
