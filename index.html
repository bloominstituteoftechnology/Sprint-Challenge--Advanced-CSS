    <h1>Lift Off</h1>

    <p> As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
      marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate,
      that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man. </p>

      <p> Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe,
        having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet. </p>

      <p>which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.

       <h1>Let's Go For A Walk </h1>

       <p> The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The
         Earth was absolutely round. </p>

       <p>It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my
         thumb blotted out the planet Earth. </p>
