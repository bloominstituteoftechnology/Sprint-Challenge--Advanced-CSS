<!--Sprint Challenge Questions
1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
  Responsive responds to size of a browser at any given point.
  Adaptive websites adpat to the width of the browser at specific points.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
  Mobile first means your designing the webpage based on the sizes of a mobile display first, then adding changes for a desktop. Desktop is the opposite.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
  This sets the incremements to 1 REM = 10px. Making it easier to calculate. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
  Preprocessing makes layouts easier to implement and read because you can use mixins, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
  Mixins, thus far are my favorite. The concept that is giving me the most trouble is importing the less files in the proper order-->

      <h2>Lift Off</h2>
    
      <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

      <h3>Can We Visit Planets?</h3>
    
      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>
    
      <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

        <h3>Let's Go For A Walk</h3>

        <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.</p>
      
        <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
