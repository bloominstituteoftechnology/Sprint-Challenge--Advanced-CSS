1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    * The difference between adaptive website and fully responsive is with adaptive design adapts itself to various screen resolutions that are predefined. This has a disadvantage because with this technique you have to create multiple layouts to cover various screen resolutions and one can't cover all the resolutions available because there are some screen resolutions that are odd but exist. Meanwhile responsive design provide a precise viewing experience across all devices. An advantage of this from the adaptive layout that the responsive design uses one master layout so it will load faster. 

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    * Mobile first focus on the mobile experience being the best as possible without ignoring desktop users. This is the preferred method because as studies show most users are mobile these days. Desktop first focuses on making the desktop experience as best as possible without ignoring the mobile.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

    * This is a neat trick (thanks Dan) that makes rem very easy to use since we are taught to use pixels first. Every 1 rem is 10 pixels so 1.2 rem is 12px. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

    ![Example](img/car.jpg) 

    * "slaps roof of car" this baby will help you reuse pieces of CSS like making variables for those colors you reuse on your website, make everything a bit more pleasing to the eyes with nesting and talking about reusable you can create mixins that to put an example are like Javascript functions that you can call anytime you want, pass values, etc that change that element.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing?  What is the concept that gives you the most trouble? 

    * My favorite concept are variables and mixins. They make CSS very clean and easy to mantain. also mixings make certain lines of code reusable saving us time. The most I struggle with are nesting when something is too nested and doesn't work for some reason but I try not to nest too much to avoid this problem.
