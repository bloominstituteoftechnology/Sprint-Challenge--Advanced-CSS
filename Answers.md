1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
Adaptive websites respond to browser widths at specific break points, while responsive websites respond to browser widths across the whole spectrum. As you toggle the width of the page, an adaptive design will snap into place once it reaches a certain breaking point, while a responsive design will fluidly change as the width changes.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
When you design a website desktop first, it is with the assumption that most people who visit it will do so on a desktop computer. The design is then modified, or scaled down, to adapt to tablets and mobile devices. When you design a website mobile first, you create a user experience that favors mobile devices first and foremost. The website is then scaled up to adpat to bigger screen sizes.

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
 Rem units are based on the font-size of the root element (the html element in this case). A user will usually have their browser's base font size set at 16px. This will result in a font size of ( 16px x 62.5% ) = 10px.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Working with pure CSS can be clunky and time-consuming. A preprocessor will extend the functionality of CSS to include things such as variables, functions, and mixins to speed up the inefficiencies of writing CSS and to give constructing a site a more logical approach. It also seperates components into smaller files, allowing you to import them into a larger main file, thus allowing you to achieve reusable, compartmentalized, easier to maintain code.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
I love the fact that you can use functions and mixins to give coding in CSS a more Javascript-like feel. It makes CSS go from a design-type framework to more of a programming-type framework. It is no longer such a hassle to deal with. The concept that has given me the most trouble up till now has been @arguments, but I'm starting to get the hang of it.
