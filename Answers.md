1. Responsive websites are coded so that their appearance adjusts at any viewpoint. A window could be resized at user's whim and the responsive website will adjust accordingly for the best viewing experience. Adaptive websites, on the other hand, use specific sizes to adjust their appearance. Only at these designated sizes will the adaptive websites reconfigure their appearance for the viewer.
2. Designing mobile first means using the mobile view of a website as the base from which all other layouts are derived. This would be a useful approach to use if you expect your website to be accessed most frequently on a mobile device. Designing a website with a desktop first perspective means using a larger desktop layout as the base from which all other layouts, including the mobile layout, would be designed. This would be more useful if your site is more intended for use in a desktop context.
3. Assigning the 62.5% attribute makes it easier to implement rem units throughout a CSS file, since the rem unit could be calculated by dividing the pixel value by 10.
4. I would explain that Less is a tool that we can use to produce CSS that's cleaner, more reusable, and often easier to read and understand. I would explain that Less allows us to create files that incorporate reusable attributes and classes that can be changed more easily as our design requirements change. It also allows us to organize our CSS so that we can nest our rules in a more organized manner.
5. I really like mixins--I think that they're a powerful tool that can really clean up our CSS, especially when we have a lot of elements with repeating attributes. Nesting can be tricky sometimes; you really have to pay close attention to your parent and child elements to make sure that they're being accessed correctly.
