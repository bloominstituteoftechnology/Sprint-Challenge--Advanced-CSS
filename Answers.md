# **Task 2: Comprehension Questions**

1. **What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?**
    * While they both employ breakpoints to cater to different screen sizes, a fully responsive site converts the widths of all elements and items on the page using percentages. This allows the ratio of each item's size to be preserved, allowing them to shrink or grow in a consistent manner.

1. **Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.**
    * Mobile first starts with and caters to the design and functionality on mobile/smaller sized screens. While a fully responsive website should allow the site to look good at every size, mobile first design prioritizes smaller screens. Desktop first is the exact opposite.

1. **What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?**
    * It changes the value of 1rem to 10px on the default/medium text size. This simplifies the use of rem units because if you think in pixels (e.g. 16px), then converting that to the more accessibility-friendly rem is as simple as moving the decimal over one number (e.g. 16px = 1.6rem).

1. **How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?**
    * I would describe preprocessing as a streamlined, intuitive, and more powerful way to write CSS. Some of it's properties, such as nesting, allow for easier and quicker organization. Others, such as variables and mixins, allow for quicker and dry-er ways to write and change code.

1. **What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?**
    * I really like variables; they're powerful and deceptively simple. I feel fairly comfortable with most everything we've learned about preprocessing, but parametric mixins can be a little tricky.
