1. The difference between a fully responsive website and a adaptive website is that a fully responsive website ususally scales with the viewport and is responsive at any resolution. An adaptive website ususally has responsive breakpoints that break at specific spots using media querys to make it responsive at the respective widths.

2. Mobile first usually means that you start with a mobile design version of your website and instead of using max-width in your media querys you would use min-width and than build your website up to a desktop layout.

3. The font-size of 62.5% makes it a lot easier for us to calculate how big rem units will be, for example if you had 2rem you would know its 20px or 1.5rem would be 15px.

4. I would describe preprocessing as a way to make it so you can layout your code so its easier to read, write, and edit but doesn't output to anything different than Vanilla CSS. It mainly just makes it a lot less tedious and a lot more convinent using variables and nested selectors/querys.

5. My favorite concept in preprocessing has to be a tie between the module code solutions that it provides developers to make reading, writing, and editing a lot easier and the variables that it provides making you able to switch colors in your theme with no hassle.
