1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Adaptive website fits into different screen sizes, but you have to create different different
layout for each screen size. This becomes a problem because you can't predict the size of the screen.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
When desinging a site for mobile first we use min-width in the media query. Mobile first design takes users who access their 
site through a mobile device and desings the site accordingly. Desktop first uses the max-width in the media query. We then adjust
the styling for mobile devices. 

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?
It sets the fon-size to 10px so 1 rem will equal 10px

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing is using a program that allows us to have added features in our CSS such as mixins and variables. The compiler than takes all those added features and turns them into CSS so that a browser can read it. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

My favorite part in preprocessing is being able to use mixins and variables. The concept that gives me the hardest time is nesting and figuring out which styling is being abled to the element.
