1. Adaptive websites changes upon specific breakpoints instead of changing as the display window changes. They are typically designed with pixel specific widths and heights.
Reactive websites typically don't use pixel widths and change as the display window changes based on percentage measurements.

2. Mobile first designs the layout of the webpage based on the mobile display sizes and then designs the desktop display sizes. Desktop first does the opposite starting with the desktop design breakpoint and then building the mobile layout.

3. Sets 1rem unit to about 10px allowing us to set 16px as 1.6rem 24px as 2.4rem etc

4. Preprocessing allows you to work with selectors in a more intuitive nested layout and provides access to constant-like variables and psuedo-functions called mixins to write in blocks of css with a simple call.

5. Mixins are my favorite. I don't have trouble understanding it. I really enjoy everything about it.
